    Basic Commands of MongoDB
        Database commands
            Database => batch12api
            # see list of db => show dbs
            # create Database =>  use batch12api
            # switch on db to other Database => use batch12api
            # check a current database => db
            # delete db.dropDatabase()

            =>  When we create a database in mongoDB you can see db in a list if 
                that database has/have min one collection

            use batch12api 
            db (global object) = batch12api

            use sampleDB
            db = sampleDB 

        Collections Commands 
            => ( collection small case ), dont give a dash(-) , you can give a _
            =>  collections must be plural  => apple(single) => apples (plural)
            # create 
                db.createCollection('collectionname')
            # delete 
                db.collectionname.drop()
            # see list of collections => show collections

        Documents Command ( CRUD => Operators )
            Record / Object / Document => { "name":"deepak" }
            # add/insert/save/create a Record
                    # single 
                        db.collectionname.insert({
                                                "city": "mumbai",
                                                "city_id": 1,
                                                "location_id": 1,
                                                "locality": "CST"
                                            })
                    # multi records
                        db.collectionname.insertMany([{...},{...},{...}])
            # read a record
                db.collectionname.find()
                db.collectionname.find(filter, projection)
                db.locations.find({city_id:2},{locality:1}) => in projection 1 means to include
                db.locations.find({city_id:2},{locality:1,_id:0,city:1})
            # update a record
                db.collectionname.updateOne({filter},{criteria}) =>  in filter we need to use operator => $
                db.collectionname.updateMany({filter},{criteria})
            # delete a record
                db.collectionname.deleteOne({filter})
                db.collectionname.deleteMany({filter})

        MongoDB Object ID
            => unique number + not null => primary key
            => "_id" => primary key
            => ObjectId => Data Type (BSON)
            => In MongoDB Records/ Document are sorted in BSON => Binary JSON (Javascript Object Notation)
            "_id" : ObjectId("63a7f18d5b613397ff68da43")

            # 63a7f18d 5b613397ff 68da43 => 12 Bytes => 24 characters
            
            # 63a7f18d => A 4-byte timestamp
            # 5b613397ff => A 5-byte random value generated once per process.
            # 68da43 => A 3-byte incrementing counter, initialized to a random value.

    operator update and some of are for find
        $set => data update/ add new Fields
        $unset => remove Fields
        $rename => Fields
        $and => logical
        $or => logical
        $in => in is used to search in array
        $gt => Greater Then
        $gte => Greater Then Equals To
        $lt => Less Then
        $lte => Less Then Equals To
